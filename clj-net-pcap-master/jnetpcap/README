jNetPcap is developed and released by Sly Technologies: http://jnetpcap.com/


As I am providing readily compiled versions for download I also provide a copy 
of the original source code as released by Sly Technologies as well as patches
that had been applied for creating the jNetPcap version that is available here.

Additionally, the i386 Linux native libs had not been available from 
jnetpcap.com but are customly compiled.


All changes/patches and compiled files are released under the terms of the LGPLv3.
This is the same license under which the original jNetPcap code is released as well.

All this is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) for more details.
